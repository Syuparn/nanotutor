# Preface

nano is a simple editor. You may use it easily without any troubles. On the
other hand, it has more useful shortcuts than you expected. Let's practice!

These lessons take 15~20min to complete.

This is inspired by vimtutor, the tutorial lessons to learn Vim commands.

NOTE: Some lessons modify this text. Make sure you have a copy of original
text file! If you start `nanotutor`, this is already a copy.
