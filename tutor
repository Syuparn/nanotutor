# Preface

nano is a simple editor. You may use it easily without any troubles. On the
other hand, it has more useful shortcuts than you expected. Let's practice!

These lessons take 15~20min to complete.

This is inspired by vimtutor, the tutorial lessons to learn Vim commands.

NOTE: Some lessons modify this text. Make sure you have a copy of original
text file! If you start `nanotutor`, this is already a copy.

# Lesson 1: Moving the cursor
## 1.1: Basic

You can move the cursor by arrow keys `[up]` `[down]` `[left]` `[right]`.
Using `[down]` key, move to lesson 1.2.

## 1.2: Move farther

Tired of typing? With `ctrl + (arrow key) , you can move farther.

ctrl + [up]    : to previous block
ctrl + [down]  : to next block
ctrl + [left]  : to previous word
ctrl + [right] : to next word

Using `Ctrl + [down]` key, move to lesson 1.3.

## 1.3: Move to the top/end

NOTE: read the entire lesson before typing these shortcuts!

alt + \ : to the top of this text
alt + / : to the end of this text

Try these shortcuts and then go on to Lesson 2.

# Lesson 2: Exit nano
## 2.1: Exit

NOTE: read the entire lesson before typing these shortcuts!

Exit nano by `ctrl + x`. You may be asked if you want to save modified text.
Then get back here by executing `nanotutor` command.

# Lesson 3: Editing
## 3.1: Cut and paste buffer

ctrl + k : cut current line into buffer
ctrl + u : paste contents from buffer

Sort the lines below in order.

4. fox
1. The
7. the
8. lazy
3. brown
9. dog
5. jumps
6. over
2. quick

## 3.2: Copy buffer

You can copy lines instead of cutting them.

alt + 6 : copy current line into buffer

Copy the second line several times to make this building higher.

========
| H  H |
========

## 3.3: Undo and redo actions

alt + u : undo last action
alt + e : redo last undone action

Delete some words in the sentence below, then undo and redo the action.

> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

# Lesson 4: Search and replace
## 4.1: Jump to the specified line

NOTE: read the entire lesson before typing these shortcuts!

alt + g : go to specified line

Jump to line 50. Then jump to line 99 to move back here.

## 4.2: Go to the complementary bracket

alt + ] : go to complementary bracket

Move the cursor to just before the any open bracket `[`, `(`, `{` and jump to the corresponding close bracket.

```
(()=>{console.log(["a"][0])})()
```

## 4.3: Search

ctrl + w : start forward search 
ctrl + q : start backward search

Once you started a search, you can use these shortcuts to jump to occurrences.

alt + w : find next occurrence
alt + q : find previous occurrence

Search the word `Lesson`.

## 4.4: Replace

alt + r : start a replacing session

Replace capital H with lower case h.

> SHe sells seasHells by tHe seasHore.

## Lesson 5. Macros
### 5.1: Record and replay macros

alt + : : Start or stop recording macro
alt + ; : replay macro

Append `!` at the end of each sentence.

- 1. move the cursor to the end of the first line
- 2. start recording
- 3. append `!` and move to the next line
- 4. stop recording
- 5. replay recording until all sentences have `!` at the end

```
Hello Mike
Hello John
Hello Tom
Hello Bob
```

# Lesson 6: Show information
## 6.1: Show line numbers

alt + n : turn line numbers on/off

Show the line numbers on the left. What is the number of this line?

If you always want to show it, add `set linenumbers` to `~/.nanorc`.

## 6.2: Report cursor position

ctrl + c : report cursor position

Show the current cursor position. If you move the cursor, does the report change?

## 6.3: Show help

ctrl + g : open help document

There are still many more shortcuts in nano. See official help to learn more shortcuts.

# Congratulations!

That's all for the lessons. I hope you have become more familiar with nano.
